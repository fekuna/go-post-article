### Golang Post-Articles REST API ðŸš€

Note:
    1. make sure you have docker installed on your local machine 
    2. there's no application run on PORT 3306 on your local machine
    3. you have [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) on your local machine

#### Recomendation for local development most comfortable usage:
    make local // run all local containers
    make migrate_up // migrate tables to your mysql 
    make run

#### Run without docker
    make migrate_up // migrate tables to your mysql
    make run
